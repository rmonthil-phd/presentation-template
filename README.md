# Presentation Template

Presentation template I used for most of my PhD presentation.

# Dependencies

To install, use and compile this template, one will need:
- git
- pdflatex
- various latex packages including pgfplots

One could also use [overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com) to avoid installing pdflatex and latex packages locally.

# Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rmonthil-phd/presentation-template.git
```

# Compilation

```bash
pdflatex -shell-escape main.tex
```

# Credits

* Largely based on the [feather latex beamer theme](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/modified-feather-beamer-theme-theme/hprfhrqkbzqq). I would recommend to use directly that template and only use this one as reference.
* .gitignore is slightly modified from [TeX.gitignore](https://github.com/github/gitignore/blob/main/TeX.gitignore)

# Output

![main.pdf](main.pdf  "main.pdf")
